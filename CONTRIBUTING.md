  - Screenshots or videos of visualizations.
- Submit the PR for review.

## Code Review Process
- Maintainers will review your PR promptly.
- Be open to feedback and make requested changes.
- Approved changes will be merged into `main`.

##  Reporting Bugs
- Check [Issues](https://github.com/zuck30/neural-network-visualizer/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- Open a new issue with:
  - Clear title and description.
  - Steps to reproduce.
  - Expected vs. actual behavior.
  - Screenshots or videos (e.g., of rendering issues).
  - Environment (OS, Node.js version, browser).

##  Suggesting Features
- Open an issue with the `enhancement` label.
- Describe the feature, its benefits, and possible implementation.
- Include mockups or example outputs if applicable.

##  Coding Guidelines
- **Frontend**:
  - Use React hooks and functional components.
  - Follow Tailwind CSS utility-first approach.
  - Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- **TensorFlow.js**:
  - Optimize models for browser performance.
  - Validate input data for problem types.
- **Three.js**:
  - Minimize draw calls for smooth 3D rendering.
  - Support WebGL compatibility across browsers.
- **General**:
  - Add tests (place in `tests/` directory, e.g., using Jest).
  - Update documentation for new features.
  - Keep comments clear and concise.

## üõ†Ô∏è Areas for Contribution
